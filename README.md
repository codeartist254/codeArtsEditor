# codeArtsEditor
CodeArts Editor is an app that letâ€™s us view the raw markdown on the left side and the converted markdown (to HTML) on the right side. CodeArts254 will also allow multiple people to work on the same markdown document at the same time via a shareable URL and all changes will be saved.
